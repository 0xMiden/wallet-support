/**
 * Bottom-sheet motion: the tab-bar springs, expressed as CSS so vaul can run them.
 *
 * Every sheet in the app should open and close with the same feel as switching nav tabs — bouncy
 * on the way in, snappy on the way out — rather than vaul's stock half-second tween. vaul drives
 * the sheet with a CSS `animation` (open/close) and an inline `transition` (the drag-release
 * snap-back), so the spring cannot be a framer transition here: it has to be a curve CSS can
 * consume. `springToLinearEasing` solves the spring analytically and emits it as `linear()`, which
 * keeps the overshoot and hands the whole thing to the compositor.
 *
 * Duration depends on the distance travelled, so the curves are solved once against a nominal
 * sheet travel. A shorter sheet settles a little sooner than the curve says and a taller one a
 * little later; neither is perceptible, and solving per sheet would mean measuring the element
 * before it is on screen.
 *
 * Reduced motion is NOT handled here: the `prefers-reduced-motion` block in `main.css` clamps
 * every vaul duration to nothing, which covers these curves along with vaul's own.
