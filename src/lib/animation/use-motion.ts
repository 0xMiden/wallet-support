/**
 * Reduced-motion-aware transition helpers.
 *
 * PR-7: when the OS reports `prefers-reduced-motion`, spring transitions
 * across the new dApp browser module collapse to an instant tween. The
 * goal is to kill any bouncy / spring motion but preserve the
 * *structural* transitions (the switcher still animates in/out, etc.)
 * so the information hierarchy stays intact for users who can parse
 * motion but find springs overstimulating.
 *
 * Every animated component in the new browser stack should route its
 * transitions through these helpers instead of importing from
 * `springs.ts` directly — that way the reduce-motion switch flips
 * uniformly across the whole experience without a per-component audit.
