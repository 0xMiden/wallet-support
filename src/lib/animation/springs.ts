/**
 * Centralized spring physics presets for the wallet UI.
 *
 * Stiffness/damping values are derived from iOS UIKit (response, dampingRatio):
 *   stiffness = (2π/response)^2
 *   damping = 4π * dampingRatio / response
 *
 * Use these presets via framer-motion's `transition` prop instead of inlining
 * spring config in components. This keeps animation feel consistent across
 * the app and lets us tune the whole system from one place.
 *
 * Naming guide:
 * - `snappy`: button presses, taps, capsule chrome
 * - `standard`: default screen / sheet motion (response 0.4 / 0.85)
 * - `magnetic`: bubble fly-to-corner with overshoot
 * - `settle`: bubble final landing (no bounce)
 * - `sheetPresent`: bottom sheet present/dismiss
 * - `pill`: footer tabbar pill (existing precedent)
 * - `dragRelease`: post-drag rebound
 * - `tabSwitch`: a tab bar's highlight sliding to the new tab — one visible
 *   overshoot (~7%), settled within ~340ms even across three tabs
 * - `tabIconPop`: the newly active tab icon rising to its pop scale, quickly
 *   and without overshoot, before `tabSwitch` brings it back to rest
